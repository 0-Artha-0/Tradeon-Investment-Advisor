            - Summarize key takeaways from historical data. Highlight similar past scenarios(numerical ranges); discuss how their outcomes influenced current decision. Explain any adjustments made.

        **6. Holistic Reasoning and Decision Justification: **
            - Synthesize findings from current data AND Past Performance Memory insights. Explain how factors collectively lead to the decision. Address conflicting signals, noting if memory helped.

        **7. Disclaimer: **
            - Always include: "This analysis is based on provided data and AI models. It is not financial advice. Market conditions are subject to rapid change, and investors should conduct their own due diligence."
